## MY PORTFOLIO 

*A glimpse of some of the projects I've been working on.*

**Predictive Modeling and Hypothesis Testing to help an HR Department Reduce/Plan for Attrition.**

Summary: During this project, we were portrayed as consultants to a company looking to understand and plan for attrition within their company. We used statistcal modeling to find the various important attributes and then used them to train a Decision Tree and Logistic Regression model to predict which employees would leave versus which would stay.

Summary: Launched this project after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and response of massive increases in home values across the United States in the years after. Main objectives were to conduct exploratory data analysis to identify key factors causing the increase in home prices and also to build a linear regression model that could predict future home prices.

Summary: Completed this project as part of coursework at Georgia Tech Micromasters in Analytics program. We are provided credit card data from a subset of customers and seeking to build a model to classify customers between 0 and 1. This will help the bank assess creditworthiness, manage risk and improve customer service. I went with a Support Vector Machine model and a K-Nearest Neighbor's Model and compared the performance on a validation and test data set to determine which one to go with. Feel free to dive into the coding workbook at the link below!
